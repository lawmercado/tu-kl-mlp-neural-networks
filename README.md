# tu-kl-mlp-neural-networks

This branch contains the code exploring the use of Batch Normalization and Dropout. We've added it as separate material so as not to pollute the main work.

In order to see the plots yourself you can run:

`python3 report.py`

The folder with the results and logs for the models shown in the Bonus Section of the report can be generated with the following command: 

`python3 main_bn_dropout.py`

The results, however, are not entirely reproducible and small differences are to be expected (although the main conclusions should remain).
